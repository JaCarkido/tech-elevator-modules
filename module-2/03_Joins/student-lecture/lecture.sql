-- Keys, Joins and Unions
--
-- Primary Key - a column or set of columns that uniquely identify a row in a table (Parent table)
-- Foreigh Key - a column or set of columns that match the primary key of another table (Dependent table)
--
-- Natural Key - Value(s) that exist for a table that can be used as primary keys
-- Surrogate Key - Artificially generated keys to use as a primary key
--
--  Joins are used when columns from multiple tables are required in a query
--
-- INNER JOIN - Matching rows between tables 
-- 
-- OUTER JOIN - All rows from both tables - the full set      
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
-- Inner Join syntax - 2 forms
-- 
--  SELECT columns
--    FROM table1, table2  
--  WHERE table1.column = table2.column  
--
--
--  SELECT columns
--    FROM table1
--         INNER JOIN
--         table2
--      on table1.column = table2.column
--
-- Additional WHERE predicates may be added to either syntax to filter rows
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
-- -- OUTER JOIN syntax 
--
--  SELECT columns
--    FROM table1
--         FULL OUTER JOIN
--         table2
--      on table1.column = table2.column
--
-- Additional WHERE predicates may be added to either syntax to filter rows
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
-- UNION - Merging rows between two tables
--
-- Each SELECT must have the same number of columns in the same order and be compatible datatypes 
--      use literals if necessary to make the UNION work
--
-- SELECT columns
--   FROM table1
-- WHERE predicate
--
-- UNION
--
-- SELECT columns
--   FROM table2
-- WHERE predicate
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
--
-- UNION All - Concatenating rows between two tables
--
-- Each SELECT must have the same number of columns in the same order and be compatible datatypes 
--      use literals if necessary to make the UNION work
--
-- SELECT columns
--   FROM table1
-- WHERE predicate
--
-- UNION ALL
--
-- SELECT columns
--   FROM table2
-- WHERE predicate

-- But when did they return the rental? Where would that data come from? From the rental table, so letâ€™s join that.

-- What did they rent? Film id can be gotten through inventory.

-- What if we wanted to know who acted in that film?    

-- What if we wanted a list of all the films and their categories ordered by film title

-- Show all the 'Comedy' films ordered by film title

-- Finally, let's count the number of films under each category
